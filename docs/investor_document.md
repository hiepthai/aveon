# Aveon Project Investor Document

## Executive Summary

Aveon is a groundbreaking educational technology (EdTech) platform that transforms the passive Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) model into an active "intellectual gym." It helps users not only store knowledge but also actively train and reinforce it. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), Aveon automatically converts notes into flashcards, quizzes, case studies, and small practical projects, personalizing the learning experience and enhancing knowledge retention and skill proficiency.

The global EdTech market is booming, with the AI in education market projected to reach $32.27 billion by 2030 [1]. Aveon positions itself as a unique solution, distinct from traditional PKM tools like Notion or Obsidian, by focusing on learning outcomes and providing AI-powered active learning tools. Its diverse business model, including Free, Pro Learner, and Team/L&D plans, along with potential revenue from paid learning paths, promises significant returns in a highly promising market.

Aveon is seeking investment to accelerate product development, expand market reach, and solidify its leading position in the AI-driven active learning segment.



## 1. Problem

In an era of information overload, managing and retaining knowledge has become a significant challenge. Existing Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) tools primarily focus on storing and organizing information but lack mechanisms to transform that knowledge into actionable insights and reinforce retention. Learners often face difficulties in:

-   **Long-term knowledge retention:** Information is easily forgotten if not regularly reviewed and applied.
-   **Converting knowledge into skills:** The gap between theory and practice makes it challenging to apply knowledge to real-world scenarios.
-   **Lack of active learning motivation:** Passive review methods often lead to disengagement and boredom.
-   **Assessing learning effectiveness:** Difficulty in measuring the progress and impact of personal learning.

These issues lead to wasted time and effort in the learning process, hindering the development of personal skills and capabilities.



## 2. Solution

Aveon offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges of knowledge management and learning, by transforming the traditional PKM model into an active and personalized learning system. Our solution focuses on converting acquired knowledge into valuable practical activities, supported by AI:

-   **Transforming notes into learning tools:** Aveon uses AI to automatically analyze users' notes, documents, and code snippets, then converts them into interactive learning formats such as flashcards, quizzes, and case studies.
-   **Active learning and Spaced Repetition:** Aveon's system integrates a spaced repetition algorithm to optimize review schedules, ensuring users retain knowledge longer. Instead of passive review, Aveon encourages active learning through personalized tests and challenges.
-   **Practice-driven Learning:** For practical skills, especially programming, Aveon generates "tiny projects" (code katas) based on the user's notes. These projects are automatically graded with unit tests, providing instant feedback and helping learners apply knowledge in real-world scenarios.
-   **Assessment and progress tracking:** An intuitive dashboard displays learning progress, the number of flashcards due, and upcoming quizzes. Users receive notifications, e.g., "Today: 10 flashcards - estimated 12 minutes.", helping them maintain learning discipline.
-   **Improved retention and reduced time-to-proficiency:** By combining AI, spaced repetition, and practice-driven learning, Aveon significantly helps users improve knowledge retention, reduce the time required to master a new skill, and enhance engagement with the learning process.

**Real-world example:** A user collects material about "design patterns in React" (30 notes + 10 code snippets). Aveon's AI will automatically generate a set of flashcards, quizzes, and 2 case exercises. The system will schedule reviews using spaced repetition and create a related "tiny project" (code kata), then grade it with unit tests. As a result, the user not only understands the theory but can also apply it in practice, reinforcing knowledge effectively.
