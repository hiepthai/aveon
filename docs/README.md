# Aveon Project

## AI Learning Companion (PKM → Personal Learning Gym)

## Overview

-   Transition from a **passive PKM system** (knowledge storage) to an
    **active training tool**.\
-   AI transforms notes into flashcards, quizzes, case studies, and
    small projects to practice skills.\
-   Functions as a **personal intellectual gym** helping users retain
    knowledge and enhance proficiency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Real-world Example

**Scenario:** A user collects material about "design patterns in React"
(30 notes + 10 code snippets).

**AI Actions:**\
- Automatically generates a set of flashcards, quizzes, and 2 case
exercises.\
- Schedules reviews using spaced repetition.\
- Creates a "tiny project" (code kata) and grades it with unit tests.

**Result / Sample UI:**\
- Dashboard displays progress, number of flashcards due, and today's
quizzes.\
- Notification: *"Today: 10 flashcards --- estimated 12 minutes."*

**Benefits:**\
- Improved retention (users remember longer).\
- Reduced time-to-proficiency.\
- Higher user retention.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Monetization Potential

-   **Subscription appeal:** 9/10 (e-learning market is growing
    strongly).\
-   **Target customers:** professionals, developers, product managers,
    skill learners; corporate L&D teams.\
-   **Suggested pricing model:**
    -   Free: basic flashcards with limited quantity.\
    -   Pro Learner: \$10--20 / month --- unlimited flashcards, spaced
        repetition, practice tasks.\
    -   Team/L&D: \$12--30 / user / month --- reporting, cohort
        management, LMS export.\
    -   Paid learning paths (course bundles, certification).
-   **Expected conversion:** 3--8% (higher than pure PKM due to direct
    skill-learning outcomes).\
-   **Individual ARPU:** \$12--15 / month.\
-   **Additional revenue sources:** paid course bundles, certification
    fees, corporate L&D contracts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Competitive Advantage

-   Goes beyond storing information by **activating active learning**.\
-   Differentiated from Notion, Roam, Obsidian: focuses on **learning
    outcomes** (knowledge retention, skill proficiency).\
-   Combines AI + spaced repetition + practice-driven learning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Risks & Mitigation

-   **Risk:** Users may distrust "AI quizzes" or doubt learning
    accuracy.\
-   **Mitigation:**
    -   Integrate auto-grading with projects/code kata.\
    -   Provide before/after learning progress measurement.\
    -   Partner with certification providers (micro-credentials).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Metrics to Track

-   Conversion from Freemium → Paid (target: 3--8%).\
-   Individual and team ARPU.\
-   Retention: % of users completing quizzes/flashcards in the first 7
    days.\
-   Learning outcomes: improvement in average quiz scores after 4
    weeks.\
-   Net Revenue Retention (for team/enterprise).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strategic Recommendations

1.  **MVP:** focus on auto-flashcards + quizzes + spaced repetition.\
2.  **Onboarding:** allow users to import notes (Notion/Obsidian) →
    instant flashcards.\
3.  **Experiment pricing:** A/B test \$8 vs \$15 / month for Pro Learner
    plan.\
4.  **Expansion:** evolve into a course bundle marketplace
    (community-generated quiz paths for sale).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Suggested Improvements

-   Clarify the **unique positioning** vs. existing edtech platforms
    (e.g., Duolingo, Quizlet, Anki).\
-   Define a clearer **go-to-market strategy** (channels: dev
    communities, LinkedIn, coding bootcamps).\
-   Add a **B2B vs. B2C prioritization roadmap** (which market to
    penetrate first).\
-   Highlight possible **AI differentiation** (e.g., adaptive learning
    based on user errors).\
-   Suggest **content partnerships** (publishers, online educators) for
    early traction.
